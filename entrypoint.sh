# This script is the entry point for the Kodi container and it has two jobs:
#
# 1. start Kodi by calling kodi-standalone (configurable via environment
#    variable KODI_COMMAND).
#
# 2. cleanly stop Kodi when the container terminates, waiting up to 10
#    seconds (configurable via environment variable KODI_QUIT_TIMEOUT)
#    before itself exiting.
